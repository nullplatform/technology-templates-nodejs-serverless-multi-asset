## Introduction

Serverless architecture allows you to focus on writing code without the need to manage infrastructure.
This repository aims to provide you with a Node.js-based template that follow best practices for serverless development helping you get started quickly and efficiently.
In this example we demonstrate how to create two distinct AWS Lambda functions using Node.js, each function will be packaged into a separate zip file and will be deployed independently to AWS Lambda.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `function-one` directory and install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Do the same for `folder-two`

2. **Development**: Start building your serverless application using the template as a foundation.

   You can run this application locally by executing:
   ```bash
   cd function-one # or cd function-two
   npm run start
   ```

Enjoy building serverless applications using this Node.js template! If you have any questions or feedback, please open an issue in the repository. Happy coding!
